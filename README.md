# Swift Style Guide

## Background

Before continuing you should take the time to review Apple's Cocoa, Swift and Objective-C Guides

* [The Swift Programming Language](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/swift/conceptual/swift_programming_language/index.html)
* [Cocoa Fundamentals Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CocoaFundamentals/Introduction/Introduction.html)
* [Coding Guidelines for Cocoa](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CodingGuidelines/CodingGuidelines.html)
* [iOS App Programming Guide](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/iphone/conceptual/iphoneosprogrammingguide/Introduction/Introduction.html)
* [Using Swift with Cocoa and Objective-C](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/index.html)
* [Swift Standard Library Reference](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/General/Reference/SwiftStandardLibraryReference/index.html)

Our overarching goals are conciseness, readability, and simplicity.

## Language

Use US English spelling to match Apple's API.  We're a diverse team, but we need to pick a single langauge.


**Preferred:**
```swift
let color = "red"
```

**Not Preferred:**
```swift
let colour = "red"
```

## Naming

Use descriptive names with camel case for classes, methods, variables, etc. Class names should be capitalized, while method names and variables should start with a lower case letter.

**Preferred:**

```swift
private let maximumWidgetCount = 100

class WidgetContainer {
  var widgetButton: UIButton
  let widgetHeightPercentage = 0.85
}
```

**Not Preferred:**

```swift
let MAX_WIDGET_COUNT = 100

class app_widgetContainer {
  var wBut: UIButton
  let wHeightPct = 0.85
}
```

For functions and init methods, prefer named parameters for all arguments unless the context is very clear. Include external parameter names if it makes function calls more readable.

```swift
func dateFromString(dateString: String) -> NSDate
func convertPointAt(column column: Int, row: Int) -> CGPoint
func timedAction(afterDelay delay: NSTimeInterval, perform action: SKAction) -> SKAction!

// would be called like this:
dateFromString("2014-03-14")
convertPointAt(column: 42, row: 13)
timedAction(afterDelay: 1.0, perform: someOtherAction)
```

For methods, follow the standard Apple convention of referring to the first parameter in the method name:

```swift
class Counter {
  func combineWith(otherCounter: Counter, options: Dictionary?) { ... }
  func incrementBy(amount: Int) { ... }
}
```

### Enumerations

Use lowerCamelCase for enumeration values:

```swift
enum Shape {
  case rectangle
  case square
  case triangle
  case circle
}
```
## Code Organization

Use `//Mark: -` to categorize methods in functional groupings and protocol/delegate implementations following this general structure.  Note the '<>' around protocol methods.
Functions should be be seperated by a single line break.

```swift
//Mark: - Lifecycle

func init() {
  ...
}

func dealloc() {
  ...
}

func viewDidLoad() {
  ...
}

func viewWillAppear(animated: Bool) {
  ...
}

func didReceiveMemoryWarning() {
  ...
 }

//Mark: - <UITableViewDataSource>

func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAtIndexPath indexPath: NSIndexPath) -> UITableViewCell {
  ...
 }

func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, numberOfRowsInSection section: Int) -> Int {
  ...
}

//Mark: - <UITableViewDelegate>

func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, didSelectRowAtIndexPath indexPath: NSIndexPath) {
  ...
}

```
## Code Documentation

Use `/**Documentation*/` comment notation to document all public methods.  Keep the description short, but explain any input and output variables.

```swift
/**Returns an array of NSStrings in descending alphabetical order*/
func alphabeticalNames() -> [String] {

}

```

## Spacing

* Indent with tabs.
* Method braces and other braces (`if`/`else`/`switch`/`while` etc.) always open on the same line as the statement but close on a new line.
* Comment and line break between sections of code were it makes sense.  Someone else should be able to glance at your code and know what's going on.

**Preferred:**
```swift
if (user.isHappy) {
    //Do something
    
} else {
    //Do something else
    
}
```

**Not Preferred:**
```swift
if (user.isHappy)
{
  //Do something
}
else {
  //Do something else
}
```

**Preferred:**
```swift
func doSomething() {
  ...
}
```

**Not Preferred:**
```swift
func doSomething(){}
```
## Classes and Structures

### Which one to use?

Remember, structs have [value semantics](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/ClassesAndStructures.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH13-XID_144). Use structs for things that do not have an identity. An array that contains [a, b, c] is really the same as another array that contains [a, b, c] and they are completely interchangeable. It doesn't matter whether you use the first array or the second, because they represent the exact same thing. That's why arrays are structs.

Classes have [reference semantics](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/ClassesAndStructures.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH13-XID_145). Use classes for things that do have an identity or a specific life cycle. You would model a person as a class because two person objects are two different things. Just because two people have the same name and birthdate, doesn't mean they are the same person. But the person's birthdate would be a struct because a date of 3 March 1950 is the same as any other date object for 3 March 1950. The date itself doesn't have an identity.

Sometimes, things should be structs but need to conform to `AnyObject` or are historically modeled as classes already (`NSDate`, `NSSet`). Try to follow these guidelines as closely as possible.

### Example definition

Here's an example of a well-styled class definition:

```swift
class Circle: Shape {
  var x: Int, y: Int
  var radius: Double
  var diameter: Double {
    get {
      return radius * 2
    }
    set {
      radius = newValue / 2
    }
  }

  init(x: Int, y: Int, radius: Double) {
    self.x = x
    self.y = y
    self.radius = radius
  }

  convenience init(x: Int, y: Int, diameter: Double) {
    self.init(x: x, y: y, radius: diameter / 2)
  }

  func describe() -> String {
    return "I am a circle at \(centerString()) with an area of \(computeArea())"
  }

  override func computeArea() -> Double {
    return M_PI * radius * radius
  }

  private func centerString() -> String {
    return "(\(x),\(y))"
  }
}
```

The example above demonstrates the following style guidelines:

 + Specify types for properties, variables, constants, argument declarations and other statements with a space after the colon but not before, e.g. `x: Int`, and `Circle: Shape`.
 + Indent getter and setter definitions and property observers.
 + Don't add modifiers such as `internal` when they're already the default. Similarly, don't repeat the access modifier when overriding a method.


## Function Declarations

Keep short function declarations on one line including the opening brace:

```swift
func reticulateSplines(spline: [Double]) -> Bool {
  // reticulate code goes here
}
```

For functions with long signatures, add line breaks at appropriate points and add an extra indent on subsequent lines:

```swift
func reticulateSplines(spline: [Double], adjustmentFactor: Double,
    translateConstant: Int, comment: String) -> Bool {
  // reticulate code goes here
}
```

## Types

Use Swift's native types when available. Swift offers bridging to Objective-C so you can still use the full set of methods as needed.  There are times however where it is more succinct to declare a different type and you will avoid conversions.

**Preferred:**
```swift
let width = 120.0                                    // Double
let widthString = (width as NSNumber).stringValue    // String
```

**Not Preferred:**
```swift
let width: NSNumber = 120.0                          // NSNumber
let widthString: NSString = width.stringValue        // NSString
```

### Constants

Constants are defined using the `let` keyword, and variables with the `var` keyword. Always use `let` instead of `var` if the value of the variable will not change.

**Tip:** A good technique is to define everything using `let` and only change it to `var` if the compiler complains!


### Optionals

Declare variables and function return types as optional with `?` where a nil value is acceptable.

Use implicitly unwrapped types declared with `!` only for instance variables that you know will be initialized later before use, such as subviews that will be set up in `viewDidLoad`.

When accessing an optional value, use optional chaining if the value is only accessed once or if there are many optionals in the chain:

```swift
self.textContainer?.textLabel?.setNeedsDisplay()
```

Use optional binding when it's more convenient to unwrap once and perform multiple operations:

```swift
if let textContainer = self.textContainer {
  // do many things with textContainer
}
```

When naming optional variables and properties, avoid naming them like `optionalString` or `maybeView` since their optional-ness is already in the type declaration.

For optional binding, shadow the original name when appropriate rather than using names like `unwrappedView` or `actualLabel`.

**Preferred:**
```swift
var subview: UIView?
var volume: Double?

// later on...
if let subview = subview, volume = volume {
  // do something with unwrapped subview and volume
}
```

**Not Preferred:**
```swift
var optionalSubview: UIView?
var volume: Double?

if let unwrappedSubview = optionalSubview {
  if let realVolume = volume {
    // do something with unwrappedSubview and realVolume
  }
}
```

### Struct Initializers

Use the native Swift struct initializers rather than the legacy CGGeometry constructors.

**Preferred:**
```swift
let bounds = CGRect(x: 40, y: 20, width: 120, height: 80)
let centerPoint = CGPoint(x: 96, y: 42)
```

**Not Preferred:**
```swift
let bounds = CGRectMake(40, 20, 120, 80)
let centerPoint = CGPointMake(96, 42)
```

Prefer the struct-scope constants `CGRect.infinite`, `CGRect.null`, etc. over global constants `CGRectInfinite`, `CGRectNull`, etc. For existing variables, you can use the shorter `.zero`.

### Type Inference

Prefer compact code and let the compiler infer the type for a constant or variable, unless you need a specific type other than the default such as `CGFloat` or `Int16`.

**Preferred:**
```swift
let message = "Click the button"
let currentBounds = computeViewBounds()
var names = [String]()
let maximumWidth: CGFloat = 106.5
```

**Not Preferred:**
```swift
let message: String = "Click the button"
let currentBounds: CGRect = computeViewBounds()
var names: [String] = []
```

**NOTE**: Following this guideline means picking descriptive names is even more important than before.


### Syntactic Sugar

Prefer the shortcut versions of type declarations over the full generics syntax.

**Preferred:**
```swift
var deviceModels: [String]
var employees: [Int: String]
var faxNumber: Int?
```

**Not Preferred:**
```swift
var deviceModels: Array<String>
var employees: Dictionary<Int, String>
var faxNumber: Optional<Int>
```


## Control Flow

Prefer the `for-in` style of `for` loop over the `for-condition-increment` style.

**Preferred:**
```swift
for _ in 0..<3 {
  println("Hello three times")
}

for (index, person) in attendeeList.enumerate() {
  println("\(person) is at position #\(index)")
}
```

**Not Preferred:**
```swift
for var i = 0; i < 3; i++ {
  println("Hello three times")
}

for var i = 0; i < attendeeList.count; i++ {
  let person = attendeeList[i]
  println("\(person) is at position #\(i)")
}
```


## Semicolons

Swift does not require a semicolon after each statement in your code. They are only required if you wish to combine multiple statements on a single line.

Do not write multiple statements on a single line separated with semicolons.

The only exception to this rule is the `for-conditional-increment` construct, which requires semicolons. However, alternative `for-in` constructs should be used where possible.

**Preferred:**
```swift
let swift = "not a scripting language"
```

**Not Preferred:**
```swift
let swift = "not a scripting language";
```
